FIRST FRYING FRENCH FRIES {
(1) Heat oil in a wok(kadai) or pan. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium.This flame range will depend on the heaviness of the pan. For a heavy pan, keep medium flame and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low flame. The oil should have a medium-low heat or having a temprature of 130 to 135 degrees celsius.
(2) Now add the potatoes in the oil. You can fry in two batches. Do not over crowd the wok(kadai) or pan.
(3) Stir often while frying them for uniform cooking.
(4) Fry till the potatoes get cooked, but they should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.
(5) Place the half fried potatoes on paper kitchen towels. Stack 3 to 4 paper towels. Press some paper towels from top also to absorb extra oil. Let the half fried potatoes cool down at room temprature.
(6) After removing this batch, you can fry this batch of potatoes, the first batch will cool down. So in same oil, you can fry the first batch of alf fried potatoes.
